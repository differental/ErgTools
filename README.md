# ErgTools

Deployed at: https://et.brianc.tech

ErgTools is a set of simple tools for rowing performance recording and analysis, including a Split Calculator and a performance analysis tool for workouts recorded with the Concept2 ErgData app.

This is a simple project and thus does not offer any configuration options - you'll have to modify some code directly if you wish to host your own version. The project is feature-complete as of v1.0.0.

Similar features can be written as client-side JS in an SPA, which would greatly reduce the complexity of the architecture. Rust (as a separate backend) was chosen to minimise development time.
